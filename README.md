# CollatzConjecture

The Collatz conjecture is an undecidable mathematical sequence that has yet to be proven or disproven. It is quite simple. The conjecture states that given any number, if you put through the sequence an infinite number of times, you'll eventually reach the number 1. The sequence is as follows: If you have an even number, divide it by 2. If you have an odd number, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
